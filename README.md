# better-research

A comprehensive research workflow tool that integrates Zotero, reMarkable, and OCR to streamline the process from paper discovery to annotated outputs. This tool helps extract annotations from PDFs to markdown files, with support for handwriting OCR and automated synchronization across your research tools.

This tool was mostly written by *Github Copilot* with minor corrections from me. So, I don't know what the license for it should be. You should read the more detailed [README](./docs/README.md) next.

## ðŸš€ New Features

- **Zotero Integration**: Automatically download tagged papers from your Zotero library
- **reMarkable Sync**: Bidirectional sync with reMarkable tablet for annotation
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Complete end-to-end automation from library to processed outputs
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple papers efficiently

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Configure Zotero and reMarkable integration
2. **Tag**: Add `rm_to_sync` tag to papers in Zotero
3. **Run**: Execute the complete workflow
4. **Annotate**: Read and annotate on reMarkable
5. **Process**: Generate markdown and HTML outputs

```bash
# Complete workflow
python workflow_orchestrator.py --full

# Individual steps
python workflow_orchestrator.py --steps zotero upload download process
```
