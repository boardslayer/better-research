# better-research

A utility to help extract annotations from articles to markdown files. This came about from my need to annotate PDFs with a stylus. It is a pain to sit and write up your notes after you are done with the article. I wanted a way to OCR my handwriting and highlights. This tool does that. I annotate with a red marker and highlight with yellow. The tool extracts and makes a markdown file and a HTML file of the extracted content.

This tool was mostly written by *Github Copilot* with minor corrections from me. So, I don't know what the license for it should be. You should read the more detailed [README](./docs/README.md) next.

## TODO

- [ ] Integrate with Zotero
- [ ] Integrate with Remarkable APIs
